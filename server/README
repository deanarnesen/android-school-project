These are the command line arguments I used to get the plugin working
Remember if you change the DatabasePlugin module, you'll have to rebuild and then re-copy the new
jar file build into the libs folder of SQLitePlugin module. Then rebuild one more time, and you should
be set. 


I made some modifications so we can have the AbstractFactory in the implementation. It is working fine.

Now the last argument in the command line is the number of commands to be saved.

C:\Users\Dean\TicketToRide\SQLitePlugIn\build\libs   //this line will be different depending on your cpu
SQLitePlugin.jar
SQLiteDatabase

NOTE:

HOW IT WORKS? 

The IDatabase will create the DAOS.

just call the functions:

    createUserDAO()     ->  Returns : a IUserDAO object
    createPlayerDAO()   ->  Returns : a IPlayerDAO object
    createGameDAO()     ->  Returns : a IGameDAO object
